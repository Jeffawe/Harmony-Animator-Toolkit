# Harmony-Animator-Toolkit
Harmony Animation Toolkit is a suite of Unity Editor extensions that wipes away the repetitive parts of animation setup so you can stay in flow:

Generate complete Animator Controllers in seconds. Feed the tool transition data (or raw JSON), and it builds states, parameters, blend-trees, and links them to the right clips.
One-click JSON ↔︎ Animator round-trips. Ideal for Mixamo, LLM-generated data, or version-control backups.
Bulk-replace or retarget animations inside an existing controller without breaking the graph.
Instant 2D sprite animations. Create clips from sliced sheets or loose sprites with drag-and-drop ease.
Find every animation in a folder (even inside FBXs) for quick audits.
Have a quick look at the documentation at [Documentation](https://tinyurl.com/harmonytoolkit) or check the asset out at [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/harmony-animation-toolkit-325172). Everything is scriptable and interface-driven (IAnimationFinder, IJSONConverter), so power users can plug in custom search or import logic. 


Works equally well for fast game-jam prototyping or large productions that demand consistent animator structures.
